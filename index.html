         Welcome, this is my final website for my class CART211, Creative Computing and Network Culture. Scroll down to follow me through my art discovery journey. 
         Each and every artist you will see below has inspired me during the development of my own art practice and I've become quite familiar with their work. 
         Since I've been following their progress for a long time, I decided to give others my thoughts and appreciation on their overall work. Have fun exploring! :)
