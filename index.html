         Welcome, this is my final website for my class CART211, Creative Computing and Network Culture. Scroll down to
         follow me through my art discovery journey.
         Each and every artist you will see below has inspired me during the development of my own art practice and I've
         become quite familiar with their work.
         Since I've been following their progress for a long time, I decided to give others my thoughts and appreciation
         on their overall work. Have fun exploring! :)

            <div class="desc">James Robert Davis is an American cartoonist, television writer,
               television producer, screenwriter, and film producer. He is best known as the creator of the comic strips
               Garfield and U.S. Acres. Published since 1978, Garfield is one of the world's most widely syndicated
               comic strips. Davis's other comics work includes Tumbleweeds, Gnorm Gnat, and Mr. Potato Head.</div>
            <div class="opinionTitle">My thoughts:</div>
            <div class="opinion"> I grew up reading Garfield and it was a big part of my childhood. I have read every
               Garfield volume at least twice because it was my favorite book to borrow from the library at the time. Even if the artl style was simple, it was clean and easily recognisable.

               that he felt he had achieved all he could in the medium.</div>
            <div class="opinion">Calvin and Hobbes was the only english comic I read while growing up so it means a lot
               to me. Not only did it introduce me to the english lagnuage, it always gave me a good laugh and reading
               it lifted my mood. The art style is also simple and it does not have a lot of details but it's very clear.</div>

His work has always lifted my mood or made me smile because of his humorous take on his animations. In terms of art, the characters in his videos look simple, but as of late, they've become complex in terms of cinematography. The angles in the videos are wider and the animations are smoother. If you were to watch an old video and compare it to a recent one, the difference would be noticeale easily.</div>

The art style in it is old-fashioned as it is an old book. However, the exaggerated facial expresisons on the charcaters, the backgrounds and the great attention to detail makes it a very good read.</div>

            their messages and their jokes across to their viewers.</p>

            mangas. The transition from full-colored comics to black and white ones was definitely a bit strange at
            first, but I learned to appreciate all the different art styles nevertheless. I started getting interested
            in art at the time and wanted to give it a go. I also started looking into artist's art instagrams.</p>
