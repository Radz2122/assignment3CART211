         Welcome, this is my final website for my class CART211, Creative Computing and Network Culture. Scroll down to
         follow me through my art discovery journey.
         Each and every artist you will see below has inspired me during the development of my own art practice and I've
         become quite familiar with their work.
         Since I've been following their progress for a long time, I decided to give others my thoughts and appreciation
         on their overall work. Have fun exploring! :)

            <div class="desc">James Robert Davis is an American cartoonist, television writer,
               television producer, screenwriter, and film producer. He is best known as the creator of the comic strips
               Garfield and U.S. Acres. Published since 1978, Garfield is one of the world's most widely syndicated
               comic strips. Davis's other comics work includes Tumbleweeds, Gnorm Gnat, and Mr. Potato Head.</div>
            <div class="opinionTitle">My thoughts:</div>
            <div class="opinion"> I grew up reading Garfield and it was a big part of my childhood. I have read every
               Garfield volume at least twice because it was my favorite book to borrow from the library at the time. Even if the artl style was simple, it was clean and easily recognisable.

               drawing Calvin and Hobbes at the end of 1995 with a short statement to newspaper editors and his readers
               that he felt he had achieved all he could in the medium.</div>
            <div class="opinion">Calvin and Hobbes was the only english comic I read while growing up so it means a lot
               to me. Not only did it introduce me to the english lagnuage, it always gave me a good laugh and reading
               it lifted my mood. The art style is also simple and it does not have a lot of details but it's very clear.</div>

Uderzo retired in September 2011.</div>
            <div class="opinion">Astérix was the first ever comic I've read. Every character in the comic is so unique that they're recognisable by their silhouette alone. It's very detailed and colorful which makes it a pleasant read.</div>

            <div class="opinion">Manfung is an artist I've followed for a while now. I really like their art because it's always so colorful and it inspires me in my own work.

            <div class="opinion">The art style in these mangas is incredible. The mouvements made by the characters, jumps, leaps, fights, they all have a certain fluidity to them. In this specific manga Vagabond, his panels are very detailed and they have elegant backgrounds.</div>

Fujisawa's best-known work is Great Teacher Onizuka (GTO) about a biker, Eikichi Onizuka, and his attempt to become and remain a teacher.</div>
            <div class="opinion">The manga seen in the picture is Great Teacher Onizuka. It's one of the first mangas I've ever read and the most marking. The art style in it is old-fashioned as it is an old book. However, the exaggerated facial expresisons on the charcaters, the backgrounds and the great attention to detail makes it a very good read.</div>

         <h2>How it started</h2>
         <p>I was first introduced to art through comics. As a kid, I went to the library every weekend to read and to
            borrow books. I would often borrow tons of french comics.</p>

         <h2>Youtube</h2>
         <p> As I grew a bit older, I started watching animators on Youtube. Most of them did small comical videos with
            simple drawings, which I really liked. The drawings were not super detailed, but somehow they always got
            their messages and their jokes across to their viewers.</p>

         <h2>Manga/ Manga style artists</h2>
         <p> A few more years pass and my taste in comics changed. I started reading japanese comics, also known as
            mangas. The transition from full-colored comics to black and white ones was definitely a bit strange at
            first, but I learned to appreciate all the different art styles nevertheless. I started getting interested
            in art at the time and wanted to give it a go. I also started looking into artist's art instagrams.</p>

         <h2>Video Games</h2>
         <p> Games have always been a part of my life growing up and they still are. I've had a GameBoy, N64, IBM computer, Nintendo DS, PSP, PS3, PC, and Nintendo Switch.
            All these platforms evolved over time and so did the art in them. I started looking into games and their art in high school. I then became interested in the making of them and decided to pursue a career in the game industry.
