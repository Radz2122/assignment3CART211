PLEASE READ
Final website for my CART 211 class
Radhika Patel

Most of the descriptions for the artists were taken on Wikipedia. However, the ratings were done and written by me.

While most of the code was also done by me, I did use a library called Flickity for the carousel. However, I customized it's CSS to fit my website and added functionalities to it in my JavaScript.

I also took inspiration online for my menu: https://codepen.io/ljc-dev/pen/zYoqbrN

Finally, I used SASS for my CSS because it's a personal preference.
